    "The calculation of propagation in an inhomogeneous one-dimensional structure can be formulated as a Cauchy problem for some differential equation. To obtain it, let us consider the obtained expression for the scattering matrix of a certain layer and set the thickness of the layer to zero. Let the problem be to determine the reflection coefficient as a function of the coordinate on the thickness of an inhomogeneous layer $r(z)$. Then the initial condition is $r(-h/2)=0$. In the equation for the scattering matrix for a thin layer of thickness $\\Delta\\ll n\\lambda$ located at a point with coordinate $z$, let $r_L = -r(z)$, and decompose the Fresnel coefficient by the small parameter $\\Delta$:\n",
