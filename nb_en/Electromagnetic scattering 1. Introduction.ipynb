    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering processes of electromagnetic radiation arise in the study of a huge variety of physical objects, from planetary and atmospheric optics to particle physics. Here we restrict ourselves to discussing classical elastic scattering of electromagnetic waves, for which the problem statement includes consideration of a scatterer - a two-dimensional or three-dimensional object occupying a region of two-dimensional or three-dimensional space $\\mathcal{D}$, the volume of which $V_s$ is entirely inside some finite sphere of radius $R_{out}$ with its center in the chosen Cartesian coordinate system $OXYZ$ (or $OXY$ in the two-dimensional case). In an infinite region of homogeneous isotropic space $\\mathbb{R}^3\\backslash\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rigorous consideration from the point of view of solutions of Maxwell's equations is necessary in cases where the characteristic size of the scatterer/scatterers, or the characteristic size of spatial inhomogeneities in the problem is comparable to the wavelength. For small sizes, either the effective medium approximation or the Rayleigh scattering approximation is used. For large objects, the physical optics approximation, the geometric theory of diffraction, or even the geometric optics approximation are used. From the point of view of both mathematical and numerical methods of scattering analysis, when it is necessary to apply rigorous electromagnetic theory, a distinction is made between cases of single-particle and multiparticle scattering. They are discussed separately below."
