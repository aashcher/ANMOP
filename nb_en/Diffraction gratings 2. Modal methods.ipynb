    "Modal methods can be applied to solve various problems with different geometries. The basic idea is to calculate a complete modal basis in different regions of space, and then stitch the bases together at the boundaries of neighboring regions using conjugation conditions. In this case, due to the mutual non-orthogonality of the bases in different subspaces, overlap integrals of different modes arise. Here, this idea will be demonstrated using the example of a one-dimensional photonic crystal slab."

The sequence of steps remains the same as in the formulation of the modal method, namely, solving the eigenvalue problem in an infinite photonic crystal, finding the T-matrix of the flat boundary, and finding the scattering matrix of the flat layer of the crystal. The third step is identical to the one described above, so here we present the details of the first two steps.\n",
