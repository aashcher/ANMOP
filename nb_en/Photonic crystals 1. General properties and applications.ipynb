    "## Photonic crystals\n",
    "\n",
    "A photonic crystal is a periodic structure in one, two, or three dimensions in which the material parameters relating the fields in the material equations for the electromagnetic field change periodically. In the theoretical description of photonic crystals, one usually starts by considering an infinite periodic structure that fills the entire space. In practice, examples of photonic crystals include periodic multilayers - Bragg gratings (one-dimensional), - etched long cylindrical cavities or periodically arranged cylinders on a substrate (two-dimensional), and artificial opals (three-dimensional). Profiled one-dimensional and two-dimensional diffraction gratings whose material distribution is invariant along the depth can also be considered as layers of corresponding photonic crystals.\n",

    "The terminology of photonic crystals has arisen from analogy with the terminology of a branch of the solid state physics where periodic potentials are considered. Electrons in solid crystalline solids can be described using the zone theory. Such concepts as inverse lattice, Brillouin zones, forbidden zone appear in the optics of periodic media as well. Thus, for example, in photonic crystals it is possible to find frequency intervals in which there are no propagating eigen solutions, in other words, all waves excited within these intervals will be evanescent. Such intervals are called band gaps. The possibility of formation of band gaps for all possible electromagnetic waves in a crystal shows its essential difference from free isotropic or anisotropic space. Therefore, one can expect a significant change in the characteristics of various sources of electromagnetic radiation placed inside or near photonic-crystal structures. Another direction of application of the special properties of photonic crystals is the creation of high-frequency resonators and waveguides by introducing defects into the ideal lattice. In this case, if all optical materials of which the photonic crystal consists are dielectric, the quality factor of such resonators can be very high."

The trajectory $\\Gamma X$ is given by changing the vector $\\boldsymbol{k} = (k_x,0)^T$. For the third zone with $m=2$, it can be seen that along the entire trajectory the slope of the dispersion curve remains small, which corresponds to the small group velocity of the waves.
