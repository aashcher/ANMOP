    "## Resonances and scattering matrix poles\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction, it was shown that the modes of photonic structures can be studied not only by solving the eigenvalue problem for the wave equation, but also by calculating the poles of the scattering matrix. The scattering matrix provides a unified way to describe a slab, allowing one to obtain both a discrete and a continuous spectrum. Let waves defined by the amplitude vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_{inc}$ be incident on some optical structure, and let the scattered field be defined by the amplitude vector $\\boldsymbol{a}_{sca}$. We write the relationship between them through the inverse scattering matrix as $S^{-1}\\boldsymbol{a}_{sca} = \\boldsymbol{a}_{inc}$. With a zero right-hand side, the solutions of this equation will be the eigensolutions $\\boldsymbol{a}_{eig}$ of the Helmholtz equation without sources, that is, the eigenvalues ​​will be determined by the poles of the scattering matrix, and the eigenvectors will be determined by the residues at these poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poles can be found by one of the numerical methods considered previously. If we study resonances in diffraction gratings, we can use the intermediate results of the Fourier-modal method, or we can approximately describe the resonances through the interference of Bloch modes. We will consider these approaches below."

    "## Relation between pole and coupled-mode description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider models for describing the resonant behavior of waveguide gratings upon diffraction of a monochromatic plane wave incident on the grating at different angles. In the framework of the approach that describes the resonant properties of waveguide gratings through the poles of meromorphic functions of the projection of the wave vector in the plane of the grating, the main parameters for constructing the reflection coefficient curve include the off-resonance reflection coefficient, which can be considered constant in a certain range of variation of the argument of the resonance function near resonance, the coordinates of the pole on the complex plane, and the pole amplitude. On the other hand, there is a more physically intuitive approach to describing the resonant properties of waveguide gratings through the formalism of coupled modes. In this case, each mode is described by the propagation constant $\\beta$, the radiation coefficient $\\alpha$, which characterizes the energy loss of the mode due to the presence of the grating (in a flat waveguide it is zero), and the coupling coefficient of this mode with the plane wave incident on the grating $\\kappa$. The excitation conditions (conservation of momentum in projection onto the plane of the grating) are described using the optogeometric parameter\n",
