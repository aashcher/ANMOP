Thus, at the first step of the algorithm, a region of the complex plane under consideration is triangulated (e.g., into equilateral triangles). At the second step, values of the function $f(z_n)$ are computed at all triangulation nodes and the points are distributed over the values of the four quadrants of the phase plane in which the computed phases occur.
