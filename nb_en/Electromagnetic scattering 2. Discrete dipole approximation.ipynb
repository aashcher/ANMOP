    "Mie theory allows one to effectively calculate the scattering parameters on spherical particles, and its generalizations - on multilayer spherical particles. If the scatterer shape differs from spherical, the calculation is significantly more complicated. For non-spherical scatterers, a number of special methods have been proposed, including the discrete dipole approximation, the method of extended boundary conditions, the discrete source method, the invariant embedding method, and their various modifications.\n",

The method is based on volume discretization and in various sources you can find it mentioned as the Method of Moments (for partitioning the volume), the Green's dyadic formalism, or simply the Volume Integral Equation method.\n",
